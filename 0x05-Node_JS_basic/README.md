0x05. NodeJS Basics

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and is primarily used for building fast, scalable, and lightweight server-side applications.

Key features of Node.js include:

Event-driven architecture: It uses an event loop that enables non-blocking, asynchronous I/O operations, making it ideal for handling multiple requests concurrently.
Single-threaded: Despite being single-threaded, Node.js can manage many connections at once thanks to its asynchronous nature.
Package management (npm): Node.js includes npm (Node Package Manager), which allows developers to use and share reusable code packages.
Node.js is popular for building RESTful APIs, real-time applications (like chat apps), and microservices, as it provides high performance and efficient handling of simultaneous connections.
